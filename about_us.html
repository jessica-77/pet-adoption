                <h2>Our Backstory</h2>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Berenice and Jessica are two animal lovers currently attending university for computer science. They wanted to provide resources to pet lovers looking to adopt, foster, rehome, volunteer, and/or donate.</p>
                    <p>We understand not everyone can fully commit to adopting a pet, so we have tried to provide different ways to make an impact to your community. Any help is appreciated and noticed by our team! Thank you for all that you do for our pets. </p>
                    <p>We see so many pets on the street, scared and in need of a forever home. We understand how difficult it can be to connect them with loving families, so we found the perfect opportunity to combine our passion for animals with our technical skills to create this platform.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>
                        Our mission is to reduce pet homelessness through community adoption events, resources, 
                        and creating connections between pets and people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We aim to provide a safe and easy way for people to find their perfect pet, while also 
                        helping those pets find their forever homes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those who are unable to make bigger commitments of adopting or fostering, are able 
                        to make donations of any amount. We also have many volunteer opportunities available for both the youth and 
                        those who are 18 and older, who want to help out in their community. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Every animal deserves a loving home, and we're committed to making that process easier 
                        for both pets and adopters through our online platform and local partnerships.
